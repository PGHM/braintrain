Trying out Kotlin, followed this course https://www.udacity.com/course/kotlin-bootcamp-for-programmers--ud9011 for a while but it turned out to be not that good. Kotlins documentation on the other hand was awesome, so I read that and made some own snippets using the language features and took some general notes.

Also doing the rest of 2016 days with Kotlin, Haskell was a bit too much, although enjoyable. I'll continue with the current tradition of trying to use tail optimized recursion as much of possible as well as immutable state.
