Day 1:

The first part of the first day's puzzle is usually very easy and so it is
this year also. AI has no problem generating the code and solving this. Strong
start.

The next part proves to be more difficult though. Special cases like two digit
words being together (twone having "two" and "one" both) prove problematic.
Pointing out that the answer is too low does not help, but pointing out
specific inputs that are wrong help a little, it goes to the right direction
but has profound flaw of trying to separate the input by white space to
separate words. There are no white spaces in the input. This happens for few
iterations and then I give up, it cannot solve the task alone.

Every iteration of the code runs nicely every time, no run time errors and the
AI seems to handle cases where there are no digits or digit words in the input
gracefully, pretty good. First the code is pretty clean, but when the
iterations start the AI mostly adds more conditions and more loops and the
code quickly becomes very unreadable. But it was not part of this challenge so
won't try to make it more readable by asking the AI to make it more readable.

I did not specify the language that I want to use and it automatically used
Python. From my experience it is the most used language in Advent of Code
solving, don't know if this had anything to do with the choice or if Python
just is the default coding language for the AI.

In the end I had to help three times until it got the code right. The code
went to the right direction every time, but slowly. Let's see how the next day
goes, I was surprised how difficult this first day proved to be.
