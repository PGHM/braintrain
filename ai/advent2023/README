This is a challenge where I try to solve all the 2023 Advent of Code puzzles
purely with AI solving them for me without writing any code. This may sound
like an easy task, but we'll see how good the AI is at solving these kind of
perfect information puzzles. The AI used is Bing Chat Enterprise.

First I'll just give the instructions directly as they are in the site and ask
it to write code that'll take the input from a local text file. AI cannot run
code so I'll run the code for it.

If the answer is wrong I'll point out the response from the Advent of Code
validator, it usually says that the answer is too high or too low.

If this does not help I'll point out some specific inputs or calculations that
are wrong. These are easy to provide from the simple example that each
assignment has. The point is that I don't reference anything in the actual
code that the AI writes, just the inputs and outputs.

If this does not work the first part of the experiment fails, but I'll
continue by pointing out what part of the code does not work. This will be
repeated until it gets the code right or I'll run out of patience / prompt
skills.
