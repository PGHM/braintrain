Will be making an orienteering app that can help to verify in competitions
whether the competitors have visited the right places by using QR codes and
positioning. (Obviously not a really good way, but will make do for this to
get use of some of the API:s in phones in Flutter)

Very good place to start is the Flutter getting started and making the first
app and then getting that going and checking the documentation for anything
that you see and do not understand. Also these are really good to read
through if you come from web / mobile development:

https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/flutter-for/android-devs
https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/flutter-for/ios-devs
https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/flutter-for/web-devs

Random notes:

- final means that the object in variable cannot be reassigned
- const keyword means that the object cannot be changed, but this keyword
  appears also in constructors and when you are creating an object you must
  still use the const keyword even when the constructor is marked constant to
  create compile-time constant, you can omit it only in constant context for
  example here "const foo = ConstantConstructor()" instead of doing "const foo
  = const ConstantConstructor()"
